In March, I have completed a 9-week, intensive, full stack web development bootcamp at Ironhack and became a Fullstack Developer.

My motto: "Learning things, improving (them) and reach the goals".

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front end (with React or Vue) or full stack (MERN or MEVN) projects. Currently I'm improving my JavaScript skills regarding clean code and code quality.

When I'm not developing, I do some coding for retro-projects, listen to music and explore the deep worlds of music on YouTube to discover new songs and bands or read books about Contemporary History.

I already worked on these projects:

- Creative Gallery
  This app was created with React/NodeJs
  - [Client Side](https://github.com/christiangerbig/creative-gallery-client)
  - [Server Side](https://github.com/christiangerbig/creative-gallery-server)

- [Trackertools](https://github.com/christiangerbig/Trackertools)
  This app was created with Express/Handlebars
- [LetterShooter](https://github.com/christiangerbig/letter-shooter)
  My very first game I created with HTML5, CSS3, Canvas and JavaScript
