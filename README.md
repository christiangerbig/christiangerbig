I have completed a 9-week, intensive, full stack web development bootcamp at Ironhack and became a Fullstack Developer. Meanwhile I improved my skills to write Clean Code and learned to apply the Redux Toolkit and TypeScript with React in my projects.

My motto: "Learning things, improving (them) and reach the goals".

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front end (with React or Vue) or full stack (MERN or MEVN) projects. 

When I'm not developing, I do some coding for retro-projects, listen to music and explore the deep worlds of music on YouTube to discover new songs and bands or read books about Contemporary History.

I already worked on these projects:

- Creative Gallery
  This app was created with React/Redux Toolkit/NodeJs
  - [Client Side](https://github.com/christiangerbig/creative-gallery-client)
  - [Server Side](https://github.com/christiangerbig/creative-gallery-server) 
- JungleSwap

- [Trackertools](https://github.com/christiangerbig/Trackertools)

- [LetterShooter](https://github.com/christiangerbig/letter-shooter)
  My very first game I created with HTML5, CSS3, Canvas and JavaScript
