In March, I have completed a 9-week, intensive, full stack web development bootcamp at Ironhack and became a Fullstack Developer.

My motto is: "I want to code that too and improve it." That is still my goal for Web Development ever since I do retro coding.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front end (with React or Vue) or full stack (MERN or MEVN) projects. Currently I'm improving my JavaScript skills regarding clean code and code quality.

When I'm not developing I explore the deep worlds of music on YouTube to discover new songs and bands.

I already worked on these projects:

- [LetterShooter] (https://github.com/christiangerbig/letter-shooter)
  My very first game I created with HTML5, CSS3, Canvas and JavaScript
- [Trackertools] (https://github.com/christiangerbig/Trackertools)
  This app was created with Express/Handlebars
- JungleSwap
  - [Client Side]  (https://github.com/christiangerbig/JUNGLE_SWAP-client)
  - [Server Side] (https://github.com/christiangerbig/JUNGLE_SWAP-server)
  This app was created with React/NodeJs
