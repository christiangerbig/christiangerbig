Hi,

I'm Christian. I'm a passionate Web Developer focused on Frontend and Backend technologies. My homebase is Hamburg in Germany.

I believe in the positive power of communication with a trust in cooperative team working making an asset from sharing different points of views.

I like to use every aspect of new technology available to reach the goals and love to code optimized solutions suiting individual requirements with respect to time, budget and target.

My motto: "Learning things, improving (them) and reach the goals".

I started to learn the fundamentals of Web Development by myself and in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack.

Meanwhile I improved my skills to write Clean Code and learned in several Udemy courses to apply the Redux Toolkit and TypeScript together with React in my projects.

My skills as a developer include JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, MongoDB, REST-APIs with Axios, Express, Handlebars, React, Redux, Node.js, HTML5 & CSS3/Sass.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front end (with React or Vue) or full stack (MERN or MEVN) projects and would like to become part of a team where I can apply, develop and share my skills.

When I'm not developing, I do some coding for retro-projects or I listen to music and explore the deep worlds of music on YouTube to discover new songs and bands.

I already worked on these projects:

  This app was created with React/Redux Toolkit/NodeJs
