ðŸš€ In March, I have completed a 9-week, intensive, full stack web development bootcamp at Ironhack.
ðŸ‘€ My motto is: "I want to code that too and improve it." That is still my goal for Web Development ever since I do retro coding.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front end (with React or Vue) or full stack (MERN or MEVN) projects.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my JavaScript skills regarding clean code and code quality.
