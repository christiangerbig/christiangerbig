Hi,

I'm Christian. I'm a Web Developer focused on Frontend and Backend technologies. My homebase is Hamburg in Germany.

I started to learn the fundamentals of Web Development by myself and as a Full Stack Web Developper at Ironhack.

My skills as a developer include JavaScript(ES6), TypeScript, React, Redux, Vue, Vuex, Cypress, MongoDB, Supabase, REST-APIs with Axios, NodeJS, NextJS, HTML5 & CSS3/SCSS/Sass.

I improved my skills to write Clean Code and learned in several Udemy courses to apply the Redux Toolkit and TypeScript together with React in my projects.

Meanwhile I dived more into agile work as a trainee developer and focused on Typescript, NextJS and React.

I would like to become part of a team where I can apply, develop and share my skills.

I believe in the positive power of communication with a trust in cooperative team working making an asset from sharing different points of views.

I like to use every aspect of new technology available to reach the goals and love to code optimized solutions suiting individual requirements with respect to time, budget and target.

My motto: Learning things, improving (them) and reach the goals.

When I'm not developing, I do some coding for retro coding projects in Assembler, hiking or I listen to music and explore the deep worlds of music on YouTube to discover new songs and bands.

I already worked on these projects:
